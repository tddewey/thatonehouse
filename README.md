That One House
============

A repository for my house. Currently my house has no code and no need for flat files, but eventually that may change. In the meantime, I expect the issue tracker to useful.

## Contributions
I'm more than open to comments on issues so long as they remain civil. There's unlikely any reason you would be creating issues (it would be a bit rude) and there is no code to merge.
